How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?


u can check where u misspelled a words and it points line which are different


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

you can easily access previous version of your file and check whant has been changed since then.
you dont have to write anything from begining.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

u might forget to commit changes/ crash or sth and u lose. commits might be too big or too small
u create commits when u feel thats the moment to do it. however u might forget to do it :)


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others,
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

it saves your time, so u dont have to commit all changes separetly.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

- git log shows the history of git's commits
- git diff - show what has been changed between 2 commits - deletation or insertation?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

if u r good enough with git u can bring back the previous commits so u dont have do write everything from a scratch.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

for everything!
